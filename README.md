# Salary Calculator
This is a program that computes the salary of employees according to specific rules

## Requirements
Make sure that you have installed python (from 2.7 on)

## Architecture 
There are 3 main files:
1. master.py which is the master file that has to be executed to run the program
2. load_data.py which asks for the path to the data that will be computed and loads it in the right format
3. compute_employees_salary.py which makes the computation of the salaries

Another important file is test_py which contains the test cases 

## Getting started and execution
1. Download this repository and make sure that the name of the folder is: ioet_exercise
2. Open your terminal and go to ioet_exercise folder

3. Run the program using the following command:
```
python master.py
```
The program is going to ask you to provide the path to the data that you want to compute (make sure that the path is written inside quotation marks). You can use the exemplary data that comes in this repository.

```
python test.py
```
